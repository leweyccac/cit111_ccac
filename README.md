## About me 
Joined the military at the ripe age of 18. Worked as an aircraft mechanic for 7 years and absolutley loved it. 

I deployed 3 times, twice to Afghanistan and once to Turkey. I earned the nickname A10 God by the people that I worked with. 

I developed a low cost design to an electrical system testing switch that plugs directly into 4 ports and indirectly into as many ports that have 28VDC power. I developed this device in the little free time that I had when I was deployed in Afghanistan. 

I wanted to stay in, but something kept telling me to get out and pursue an education, so that is what I did and here I am. Lets play with some coding!
